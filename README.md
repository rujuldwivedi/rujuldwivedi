## 🧑‍💻 About Me

Hi! I'm Rujul — a passionate developer who thrives at the intersection of code, creativity, and curiosity. I love building real-world projects that combine clean engineering with personal passion — from cryptography tools to music discovery apps.

> 🔬 I explore the universe through code — be it modeling PDEs with PINNs or swiping on songs like it's Tinder!
