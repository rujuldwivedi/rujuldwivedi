> "Code like a craftsman. Learn like a physicist. Play like a kid."
> — Rujul Dwivedi

My github is looking like a resume, but I want it to be only about me and my projects and absolute dynamic stuff, but i dont want one or two of my projects. Make this into the most beautifully crafter dynamci readme which gives incredible statistic like group projects by language, how many languages, github data, and many many other thigns. Dont remove all the other info like name info, etc just make it more dynamic software techie oriented, also seeing the views/clicks on my github and some quotes and all the amazing data. Also since you have my github URL (https://www.github.com/rujuldwivedi), my Resume (https://www.tinyurl.com/rujuldwivedi), my Portfolio (https://www.rujuldwivedi.in) and my linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/rujuldwivedi), take all the necessary info like education, (first put experience, projects, skills and all according to my resume, then find anything extra from my linkedin and then data and stats from my github to blend it perfectly, use all kind of symbols (icons in skill section to give it a beautiful look) and just return me the most incredibly crafted readme the world has ever seen, like including my interests (from my linkedin bio) and just EVERYTHING!
Are you ready to return to me the best Techie readme the world has ever seen?

P.S. Don't give me plain text in the message, this might be due to the backtick symbol/character causing this malfunction, put text associated for back-ticks under comments and I'll correct them after pasting, return the full markdown now.

Absolutely—let’s make you a truly world-class, inspiring, data-rich, **dynamic GitHub README** that commands attention, oozes personality, and showcases your tech talents better than any resume ever could!
I'm blending your portfolio, resume, LinkedIn, and live GitHub stats to craft something *unforgettable*—with icons, grouped skills, activity, project stats, and engaging touches everywhere.
